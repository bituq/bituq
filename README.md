  I am a founder, and computer science student at the University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. I have worked on projects with over 5 million downloads, such as Roshade. Other notable works include Vite-plugin-squoosh; an image compression plugin for Vite that wil make your assets smaller and more manageable.
